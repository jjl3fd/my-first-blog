## To activate virtual env on Windows

Open up the Visual Studio Code Terminal by going to `Terminal >> New Terminal`
or pressing `CTRL + ~`.

Navigate to:
```
cd C:\Users\hello\Desktop\JLu\Dev\djangogirls
```

Then to activate your Virtual Environment:
```
myvenv\Scripts\activate
```

Then if you see this with the `(myvenv)` inside, you are good to go!
```
(myvenv) C:\Users\hello\Desktop\JLu\Dev\djangogirls>
```

In the CMD, us `dir` instead of `ls`. And use `\` instead of `/` to specify path names (like `Desktop\JLu\Dev`).
